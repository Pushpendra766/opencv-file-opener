# Open and transfer file using hand gesture
Note:- This is a bit of weired project and not much of practical use but it is fun to use.

Note:- I have used code for tracking hand from https://github.com/kinivi/hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe and used my own code for opening closing and transferring file.

Make sure you have camera in your computer.

Just run app.py in your system.

Open hand gesture will open the file.

Close hand gesture will close the file.

If you want use it in multiple computers make sure you have understand and changed the code according to your local server(IP address).

Also you need to create a local server first, using command python -m http.server 8000 ( local server on port no. 8000)
